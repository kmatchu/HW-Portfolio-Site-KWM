                <p>Thanks for stopping by! My name is Kevin, I'm here for all your web needs. My skills have been focused in HTML, CSS and
                    Javascript, and I have experience with writing and copy editing.</p>
                <p>A bit about me, I left upstate New York to pursue this career in Chicago. I signed up for a full-time 'bootcamp'
                    offered at Northwestern, my alma mater, and learned the basics of coding at a breakneck pace. Homeworks and projects
                    are where the mastery came from - check out the portfolio tab to see some of my work! </p>
